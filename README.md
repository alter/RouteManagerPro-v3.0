- 🔍 **Real-time Traffic Monitoring** - Captures network flows using WinDivert
- 🎯 **Process-based Routing** - Routes traffic based on executable names
- 🧠 **Smart Route Optimization** - Automatically aggregates routes to minimize routing table size
- 💾 **Persistent Routes** - Survives reboots with automatic state restoration
- 🎮 **Game & App Detection** - Special handling for games, Discord, development tools
- 📊 **Performance Optimized** - Multi-level caching, async operations, minimal overhead

## 📋 System Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- Administrator privileges
- Visual C++ Redistributables 2022
- ~50MB RAM
- WinDivert driver (included)

## 🔧 Installation

1. Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/alter/RouteManagerPro-v3.0/releases/latest)
2. Extract to your preferred location
3. Run `RouteManagerPro.exe` as Administrator

## 📖 How to Use

### Basic Setup

1. **Configure Gateway**
   - Set your VPN or secondary gateway IP (default: `10.200.210.1`)
   - Adjust metric if needed (lower = higher priority)

2. **Select Applications**
   - Choose applications from the left list
   - Click `>` to add to monitoring
   - Selected apps will have their traffic routed through your gateway

3. **Enable Monitoring**
   - Routes are created automatically when selected apps make connections
   - No manual configuration needed!

### Advanced Features

#### AI Preload
Enable "Preload IPs" to pre-configure routes for popular services:
- Discord voice servers
- Cloud gaming platforms
- AI services (ChatGPT, Claude)
- CDN networks

Edit `preload_ips.json` to customize IP ranges.

#### Route Optimization
Click "Optimize Routes" to:
- Aggregate multiple /32 routes into larger subnets
- Remove redundant entries
- Reduce routing table size by up to 80%

### Common Use Cases

**VPN Split Tunneling**
- Route only specific apps through VPN
- Keep other traffic on main connection
- Perfect for gaming while working

**Multi-WAN Load Balancing**
- Route bandwidth-heavy apps through secondary connection
- Keep latency-sensitive apps on primary
- Optimize network usage

**Development & Testing**
- Route development tools through corporate VPN
- Keep personal apps on home network
- Isolate test traffic

```cpp
// RAII everywhere
std::unique_ptr<RouteController> routeController;
std::shared_mutex cachesMutex;  // Reader-writer optimization

// Custom deleters for Windows handles
struct HandleDeleter {
    void operator()(HANDLE h) {
        if (h && h != INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) CloseHandle(h);
    }
};
using UniqueHandle = std::unique_ptr<void, HandleDeleter>;
```

// 3. Route optimization cache
std::unordered_map<size_t, CachedOptimization> optimizationCache;
```

**Lock-Free Where Possible**
```cpp
std::atomic<bool> running{true};
std::atomic<uint64_t> hits{0};

    T& Value();
    RouteError& Error();
};
```

**Graceful Shutdown Coordination**

class ShutdownCoordinator {
    std::atomic<bool> isShuttingDown{false};
    HANDLE shutdownEvent;
    
    void WaitForThreads(std::chrono::milliseconds timeout);
};
```
